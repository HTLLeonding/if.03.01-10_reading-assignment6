### IF.03.01 Basic Web Techniques -- Winter 2017
# Assignment 7: Reading Assignment

## Objective
This week's assignment is to get you familiar with Css3 topics like gradients, transitions, animations, and transformations, as well as the Css2 feature of positioning.

## Materials
Review the [handout](CssMastershipHandout.pdf) of the last lecture (what is basically a summary of the presentation shown) and check the resources as given in the following sections.

### Gradients, Corners, and Shadows
The [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients) guide for using gradients. You may skip the sections dealing with repeating gradients.

### Transitions, Animations, and Transformations
Additionally to the handout check out the [list of animatables](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#animatable-properties).

### Positioning
- [w3schools on positioning](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp)
- [TryIt of w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_position)

## Required Tasks
1. Read the materials presented above.
- Add entries to your cheat sheet as you go along with the material to be read.
- Add the cheat sheet to your assignment repository and make a pull request.

We will do a quiz during one of the next lessons where you can prove that you read the given texts carefully.

## Evaluation
When you make a pull request your cheat sheet will be graded. Most common reasons to mark down a solution would be
- One or more of the *Required Tasks* section are not satisfied
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read

## Extra Credits
Give brief answers to the questions given in the file [SampleQuestions.md](SampleQuestions.md). When you make a pull request you will get feedback on your proposed answers and some extra points on the first quiz.
